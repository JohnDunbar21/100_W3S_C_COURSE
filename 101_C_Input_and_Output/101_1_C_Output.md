# C Output

To output values or print text in C, use the `printf` function as shown below:

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
  printf("Hello World!");
  return 0;
}
```

This will output `Hello World!` to the terminal.

It is important to use double quotes when working with strings as not using them will produce an error.

You can have as many `printf` statements as you require, but they will not inseret a new line at the end of the output themselves.
