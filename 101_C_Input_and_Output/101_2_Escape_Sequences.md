# Escape Sequences

An escape sequence is a series of characters used to represent special characters that can't be typed directly or would otherwise be interpreted differently by the compiler or interpreter.

Escape sequences start with a backslash `\` followed by one or more characters.

Examples of some valid escape sequences are:

- `\n`: Inserts a new line.
- `\t`: Inserts a horizontal tab.
- `\\`: Inserts a backslash character.
- `\"`: Inserts a double quote character.
