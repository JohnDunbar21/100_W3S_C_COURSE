# C For Loops

When you know exactly how many times you want to loop through a block of code, use the `for` loop instead of a `while` loop. A `for` loop's conditions is made of three components:

1. The iterator.
2. The break condition.
3. The incrementor.

The general syntax of a `for` loop is:

```c
int i;

for (iterator; break condition; incrementor) {
  //Block of code to be executed.
}
```
