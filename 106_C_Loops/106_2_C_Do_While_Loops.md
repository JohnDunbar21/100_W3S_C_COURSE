# C Do While Loops

The `do/while` loop is a variant of the `while` loop. This loop will execute the code block once before checking if the condition is true, then it will repeat the loop as long as the condition is true. The general syntax is:

```c
do {
  // code block to be executed
}
while (condition);
```

Similarly to `while` loops, do not forget to increment whatever condition variable is being used to prevent runaway code.
