# C Variable Names

All variables must be identified with unique names, and it is recommended that descriptive names are used in order to create understandable and maintainable code.

The general rues for naming variables are:

- Names can contain letters, digits, and underscores.
- Names must begin with a letter or an underscore.
- Names are case-sensitive.
- Names cannot contain whitespaces or special characters.
- Reserved words (such as `int`) cannot be used as names.
