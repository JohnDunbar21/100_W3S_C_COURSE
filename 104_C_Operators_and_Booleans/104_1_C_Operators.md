# C Operaters

Operators are used to perform operations on variables and values. C divides the operators into the following groups:

- Arithmetic operators.
- Assignment operators.
- Comparison operators.
- Logical operators.
- Bitwise operators.

## Arithmetic Operators

Used to perform common mathematical operations.

- **Addition (`+`)**: Adds two operands.
- **Subtraction (`-`)**: Subtracts the right operand from the left operand.
- **Multiplication (`*`)**: Multiplies two operands.
- **Division (`/`)**: Divides the left operand by the right operand.
- **Modulo (`%`)**: Returns the remainder after division of the left operand by the right operand.
- **Increment (`++`)**: Increases an integer value by one.
- **Decrement (`--`)**: Decreases an integer value by one.

## Assignment Operators

Used to assign values to variables.

- **Simple Assignment (`=`)**: Assigns the value on the right to the variable on the left.
- **Add and Assign (`+=`)**: Adds the right operand to the left operand and assigns the result to the left operand.
- **Subtract and Assign (`-=`)**: Subtracts the right operand from the left operand and assigns the result to the left operand.
- **Multiply and Assign (`*=`)**: Multiplies the left operand by the right operand and assigns the result to the left operand.
- **Divide and Assign (`/=`)**: Divides the left operand by the right operand and assigns the result to the left operand.
- **Modulo and Assign (`%=`)**: Takes the modulus using the right operand and assigns the result to the left operand.
- **Bitwise AND and Assign (`&=`)**: Performs a bitwise AND between operands and assigns the result to the left operand.
- **Bitwise OR and Assign (`|=`)**: Performs a bitwise OR between operands and assigns the result to the left operand.
- **Bitwise XOR and Assign (`^=`)**: Performs a bitwise XOR between operands and assigns the result to the left operand.
- **Right Shift and Assign (`>>=`)**: Shifts the bits of the left operand to the right by the number of positions specified by the right operand, then assigns the result to the left operand.
- **Left Shift and Assign (`<<=`)**: Shifts the bits of the left operand to the left by the number of positions specified by the right operand, then assigns the result to the left operand.

## Comparison Operators

Used to compare two values, and will return *true* (1) or *false* (0).

- **Equal To (`==`)**: Returns `true` if both operands are equal.
- **Not Equal To (`!=`)**: Returns `true` if operands are not equal.
- **Greater Than (`>`)**: Returns `true` if the left operand is greater than the right.
- **Less Than (`<`)**: Returns `true` if the left operand is less than the right.
- **Greater Than or Equal To (`>=`)**: Returns `true` if the left operand is greater than or equal to the right.
- **Less Than or Equal To (`<=`)**: Returns `true` if the left operand is less than or equal to the right.

## Logical Operators

Used to determine the logic between variables by combining multiple conditions.

- **Logical AND (`&&`)**: Returns `true` if both operands are `true`.
- **Logical OR (`||`)**: Returns `true` if at least one operand is `true`.
- **Logical NOT (`!`)**: Reverses the logical state of its operand. Returns `true` if the operand is `false`, and vice versa.
